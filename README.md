# DEMO: Selenium Automation Framework With Java 21

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have Java 21 installed
2. Ensure you set java 21 within your environment variables
3. This project records with `ffmpeg`, installed from `Brew`, so be sure to install this. Otherwise, comment out the recording functionality in the `BaseTest.java` class under the @BeforeMethod setup and comment out `MonteScreenRecUtil.stopRecording();`.

## Running a Test
To run a test, simply navigate to any of the test folders under `test/java/tests` and click on the TestNG play button.
